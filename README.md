# Data Structures in Golang

This project is my personal learning journey in data structures using the Go programming language. It consists of various data structure challenges, each designed to improve my understanding of data structures and their implementation in Go. While the primary goal is my personal learning, this repository can also serve as a reference for those interested in exploring data structures in the Go language.

The project is organized into three levels of difficulty: easy, intermediate, and hard. Each level contains a set of data structure challenges to tackle. These challenges will help me gain hands-on experience in implementing and working with data structures in Go. Here are some of the key challenges:

## Things I've Learned

Throughout this project, I've gained valuable insights into various data structures and their practical implementations in Go. Here are some of the key takeaways from my journey:

- [ ] Learned how to work with arrays, from simple operations like finding the maximum element to more complex tasks like merging sorted arrays.
- [ ] Gained a deep understanding of linked lists and their insertion, reversal, and cycle detection.
- [ ] Implemented a basic hash map to store and manage key-value pairs efficiently.
- [ ] Built data structures for stacks and queues, enabling me to understand their core principles.
- [ ] Explored the concept of binary search trees and practiced inserting elements into a tree.
- [ ] Worked with graphs, including graph traversal (DFS) and shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's.
- [ ] Implemented the in-place Heap Sort algorithm, a powerful sorting technique.

These challenges have provided me with practical experience and insights into data structures, enhancing my ability to tackle real-world problems in software development. While this project is primarily for my personal growth, I hope it can also inspire others on their journey to mastering data structures in Golang.
